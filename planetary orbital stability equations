np.mu is mass ratio of the two stars 
m_1 and m_2 are the massses of the stars 
a_b is the binary seperation 
a_c is the minimum allowed semimajor axis of the planet.


all values below are place holders

m_2 = 3
m_1 = 2
np.mu = (m_2)/(m_1+m_2)

a_b = 3
a_c = (1.60+4.12*np.mu-5.09*np.mu**2)*a_b

print(a_c)
